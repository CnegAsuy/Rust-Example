# A Cargo Project that I Learned To Rust By Myself

## [main2.rs](src/main2.rs)
I want to try to learn basics such as variables; attributes like `#![allow(unused)]`; mutable variables; bin, hex, oct types etc.

## [user.rs](src/user.rs)
I tried OOP types like `impl`, `struct`, `enums` etc. I created a user with properties `name: String`, `age: u8` and `gender: Gender`. I tried this file in [main3.rs](src/main3.rs).

## [derivative.rs](src/derivative.rs)
I tried to take derivative of a func using `(f(d + dx) - f(d))/dx dx -> 0` formula.

## [main4.rs](src/main4.rs)
it writes the information about system.

## [calcualor.rs](src/main.rs)
An basic calculator for 4 basic process.

## [shapes.rs](src/shapes.rs)
Basic structs and impl for Point, Rectangle and Circle

## [main.rs](src/main.rs)
Always can be change.
